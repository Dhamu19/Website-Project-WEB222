                    <h2 class="about-info">Hello, my name is Dharmesh Patel. I was born in India but raised in Canada since I was 5. 
                        I am currently in my first year at Seneca for Computer Programming. 
                        I was previously at York University.
                        I've been coding for about 5 years now and have learned a great deal from my professors and online.
                        I really enjoy coding in my free time as its one of my favorite hobbies. My other interest include reading, running, playing the piano, and anything to do with the outdoors.

                <h2 class="reflect-content">My experience in WEB222 was amazing and very fruitful. 
                    I had previous experience with half of the content, so it was somewhat new to me, especially a lot of the JavaScript portions. 
                    I had a fun time learning those. I learned a lot of CSS tricks like the box model, different positioning of elements within a box, new properties, fonts, and values, etc. 
                    As for html nothing was new to me, nevertheless it was a great refresher. 
                    I personally want to start freelancing as a side hustle so all these concepts of Html, CSS, and JavaScript will be heavily used. 
                    As a result of this class, my confidence has grown and so it will help me start freelancing.
                    While doing so, I would gain experience and learn more along the way which would help me land a dream job. 
                    All the quizzes and assignments really helped me jog my memory on some of the concepts. 
                    It was very convenient and efficient that one of the classes were asynchronous and recorded. 
                    Because personally I had a lot of other extracurricular activities going on and it was getting hard to balance everything. 
                    I really appreciated the asynchronous class on Mondays. I can’t thank the professor enough for that. 
                    Thank you, professor, for a great semester. Hope to see you again!</h2>
